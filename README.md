####Introduction
The model describes the key physiological processes involved in renal function and its role in maintaining sodium and water homeostasis,  at the systems level based on the governing  physiological and feedback mechanisms (Figure 1). The model is not meant to be an exhaustive molecular to organ level model, but rather, to provide a backbone for further investigation.
